# A Book About Food

## Unrequested opinions from a non-expert.

This is entire series is a mixed bag of summaries of topics I’ve found interesting enough to research over the years as well as a lot of strong opinions loosely held.

I’m a 3rd generation American I come from a big Lebanese americans with a lot of crazy American Dream stories of relatives who “made it” in America. At this point we’re almost entirely assimilated, our primary connection to the culture is through the food. At this point I have a cousin in almost every major US city, and everyone in my family can cook. As you can imagine, food has a central place in my life and cooking is my passion. While my Lebanese heritage probably instilled my love for food, my pallet and my cooking venture far outside that domain.

Feeding people is my love language and my favorite way to bring people together. Consider myself a homemaker and i love to host. Throughout this book i delve into the menus from different parties I’ve hosted. I discuss the cookout as an exercise in the scalability of a menu, my mac n cheese article was originally written for a cooking class i led for some coworkers, my eggs benny party is the pinacle of my sauce making as it involves a hugely variable menu with several components. Every party needs a good signature cocktail to accompany the food, so I’ve written a chapter on designing balanced cocktails that discusses the components of a balanced dish. In many ways mixology is the ultimate exercise in balance. It’s the ultimate exercise in designing a flavor profile that has both depth and a balance without being overly complicated. Similar to the brunch party, the cookout can be an exercise in sauce making depending on the sides you choose. Most of the side recipes I’ve included here have a sauce or dressing component. This section maximizes scalability by using 2 base sauces, then branching out the final results from those base sauces.

# Hot Takes

- Limes are the worst citrus. They should be strictly relegated food and beverage from regions previously colonized by the Spanish.
- Sweet potatoes are the worst potatoes
- Ketchup sucks
- Hot dogs are not a sandwich, they’re a taco
- BBQ chips suck
- Squash shouldn’t go in drinks
- Honeydew is the worst fruit
- No one has ever deliberately chosen a pear over an apple
- Cream (cheese) doesn’t go in sushi, salad dressing, or carbonara.
- Hard boiled egg yolks are one of the worst textures in all of food.
- Potato, chicken, pasta, egg, tuna salads are in fact salads. Salads are a vehicle for dressing, not defined by healthy.
- Donuts are not meal. They're a breakfast dessert. Desserts are a snack or a course within a meal, not a whole meal.
- Sourdough bread… don’t waste your time
- Smoothies are just cold soups and many soups are hot smoothies.

# Mac and Cheese: A lesson in sauce-making

Anyone who wants to cook along should make a bechamel-based mac and cheese (see article 3). This is uses only common household ingredients and has the widest application in cooking outside of mac and cheese. Making a roux is a basic life skill, and is the base for 3/5 of [the French mother sauces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mother_sauces).

Additionally, I will also make the “modern” cheese sauce (see article 3) so we can compare it to the bechamel. I will also make a pasta water-based sauce using the technique from article 4. This should give everyone a base understanding of various sauce-making techniques.

#### Takeaways

By the end of the lesson everyone should have a basic understanding of:

- Emulsification and its applications in the kitchen
- How to make a roux and how to use it to make sauces, gravies, etc.
- Multiple methods to make mac and cheese

#### Pre-Work

### [Mise en Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place)

The most complicated part of mac and cheese is the cheese sauce, so that will be the primary focus of this lesson. If you plan on cooking along with me, all prep work should be done ahead of time. This includes chopping veggies/herbs, shredding cheese, grinding fresh spices, and cooking any meat/veggies.

#### Reading/Watching

1. [Emulsification](https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/cooking-tips/article/become-a-better-cook-4): All the cheese sauces we’re making are emulsifications. Understanding what that means will help you make a better sauce.
2. [Mornay Sauce](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/08/mornay-sauce-recipe.html): The bechamel-based sauce we’ll be making is actually a Mornay sauce.
3. [Two Roads to [...] Mac and Cheese](https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/11/how-to-make-baked-mac-and-cheese.html): This presents two methods to making great mac and cheese, we’ll explore both of them.
4. [Lighter Fettuccine Alfredo](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/09/lighter-fettuccine-alfredo-recipe.html):  This presents a third method to making a cheese sauce that we will touch on. I would also recommend the cacio e pepe episode of Good Eats Reloaded on Hulu, but the technique is essentially the same as this article.
5. [The Food Lab: 15-Minute Ultra-Gooey Stovetop Mac and Cheese](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/10/the-food-lab-fifteen-minute-stovetop-macaroni-and-cheese-recipe-food-lab-book-excerpt.html): A fourth method to making a cheese sauce, which we will not explore. However, after the lesson you should be confident enough to do this yourself.

#### Shopping List

See [the bechamel-based mac and cheese](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/11/classic-bechamel-baked-mac-cheese-recipe.html) from article 3 if you want an exact recipe.

#### Required

- Cheese
    - Approximately 2 lbs, but it’s better to have extra on hand in case you accidentally end up with too much bechamel
    - I usually use cheddar/gruyere/american with an approximate 3:2:1 ratio, respectively
    - You can sub out the cheddar and gruyere for any cheese that melts (see the table at the end of article 3)
- Pasta – Anything will do
- Milk – About a pint, but it’s good to have extra in case you need to thin out your sauce
- Butter – About half a stick, again it’s good to have extra in case you add too much flour to the roux
- Flour – About equal parts with the butter, but if the sauce gets too thin you’ll need more to thicken it up
- Mustard – I use Dijon, but yellow or spicy brown would work
- Hot sauce – Anything generic is fine, but feel free to get adventurous here.
- Nutmeg – Fresh grated is better, but ground is fine too.
- Pepper – Never buy pre-ground black pepper
- Salt – to taste

#### Optional

- [Breadcrumbs](https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-make-breadcrumbs/) (for a toasted crust)
- Garlic, Freshly minced and sautéed
- Onion, diced and sautéed
- Onions, caramelized (you can do these in a slow cooker, then freeze them for dishes like mac and cheese)
- really any [alliums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium) will work, I frequently add them to the butter when making my roux to fortify the base of the dish
- blue cheese crumbles, stir in at the end for little blue cheese bombs
- Broccoli, chopped and cooked (for the illusion of health)
- Bacon, [lardons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lardon) (to tone down the illusion of health from the broccoli)
- Mushrooms, chopped and sautéed
- Parsley/chives/green onion, chopped (to garnish)
- Anything else you want… you can really take this any direction you can imagine… kimchi/pork belly, caprese salad, phily cheese steak… it’s all fair game.

# Nouc Cham Pickled Chimichurri

First make the fish sauce mixture with approximately equal parts

- Lime juice
- Fish sauce
- Rice vinegar

Mix approximately 1 tbsp honey and 1 tsp salt per cup of total fish sauce mixture.

Use a small amount of the fish sauce mix to thin the honey and and salt. Add the thinned honey and salt to the remaining fish sauce mix.

Chop approximately equal parts

- Cilantro
- Mint
- Basil
- Scallion

Chop and add red jalapeno chilis for color and spice

You can change it up pretty easily too. The first time I made it I used Thai basil, but this recipe uses a mint/basil combo instead so it’s more accessible. You can also swap the red jalapeno for birdseye or Thai chilis.

# Duck Fat Chili Crisp

# Dinner Parties

# How to Party (without regrets)

The master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation, his love and his religion. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence at whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him he is always doing both.

# Stocks & Sauces

I wouldn’t be The Bouillonaire without a significant section about stocks and sauces.

## Stocks

Chicken feet and beef bones make the best stocks because of their high collagen content. The large amount of fat also yields some fantastic tallow schmaltz. Duck broth produces the most fat though.

## Sauces - Everything is better when it’s smothered

# Ketchup Sucks - An Ode to Mustard

Mustard is the most versatile condiment

## 3 BBQ Sauces (sweet/tangy, spicy, mustard/vinegar)

# Gravy & Pan Sauce

[Pan Sauces | Basics with Babish](https://youtu.be/ru4U_T83uOU)

#### Sausage Gravy Benny

Sausage Gravy

- Get some onions (minced/finely chopped) an garlic going in the pan with some butter
- Start cooking sausage in the same pan until the fat is rendered out
- Add flour to form a roux and start stirring in milk to make a gravy, I usually use whole milk
- Add butter/flour/milk until you get a good texture
- Fresh cracked black pepper to taste

Toast and English muffin, add sausage patty, add egg, smother with gravy

# Mornay Sauce

#### French Onion Soup Benny

- gruyere cheese sauce
- Make a roux, add some whole milk to create a sauce, Add a bunch of gruyere… like way more than you need
- Fresh cracked black pepper and butter to taste
- caramelized onions
- Add a shit load of butter to the pan with chopped onions on medium heat
- Once they start caramelizing, add better than beef bouillon
- Toast the English muffin, add onions in a ring-ish shape to hold the egg, add the egg, smoother in cheese sauce

#### Pulled pork benny

- Make your favorite pulled pork, I usually do this in a slow cooker with some onions/garlic and Dr Pepper/root beer the night before
- Make a cheese sauce following the same instructions as the French onion soup but don’t use gruyere. Probably a cheddar or some sort of blend of cheddar/gruyere. Could make this spicy
- You could also reduce the juice left in the slow cooker with a dash of bbq or mustard, then toss the pulled pork (one serving at a time) in that sauce before putting it on the benny
- Toast the English muffin, add pulled pork, add egg, smoother in cheese sauce

# Hollandaise

#### Caprese Salad Benny

- Pesto Hollandaise
- Make Hollandaise
- Add homemade pesto, which you obviously prepare in bulk and freeze in ice cube trays so you can thaw it as needed
- Melt mozzarella over toasted English muffin, add tomato, add egg, smother in pesto hollandaise

# Build Your Own Benny Bar

Benedicts should be a la carte

Fun brunch party I’ve done several times

Hard boiled egg yolks are one of the worst textures in all of food. No one has ever said “I wish this was a little more chalky”. Sometimes people respond to this and say something along the lines of “what about a 6 minute egg”. That’s a soft boiled egg.

Donuts are not meal. They're a breakfast dessert. Desserts are a snack or a course within a meal, not a whole meal.

#### Chicken in Waffles & the Breakfast Corndog

Deep fried, waffle battered breakfast sausage or chicken wings.

### Salads - A vehicle for the dressing.

Salads are not defined by how healthy they are or whether they contain leafy greens. A salad is really a vehicle for a dressing. By this definition, potato, chicken, pasta, egg, tuna salads are in fact salads.

Cream (cheese) doesn’t go in sushi, salad dressing, or carbonara; and ranch is a condiment, not a dressing.

# Mediterranean Chimmichurri - Green Onion Cucumber Salad

Oh wow thank you. I didn’t really write it down. It’s a tweak of a southeast Asian chimichuri that I’ve been making. The dressing was equal parts fish sauce, lemon juice, and rice vinegar. Honey and salt to taste and a little yogurt for fat.

Then I think for the veg it was probably like fennel, cucumber, dill, parsley, mint, yellow onion, green onion. But I don’t remember for sure. Probably do like 2 or three cucumbers per bulb of fennel. And I included all the like stringy leaves from the fennel and the white bulb, but not the green stalks.

- fish sauce
- Champagne Vinegar
- Lemon Juice
- 
- Mint
- Cucumbers
- parsley
- fennel
- 
- Black pepper
- Sesame Oil
- Honey
- 
- Olive oil

# Roasted Pineapple Salsa

- pineapple
- jalapeño
- red onion
- green onion
- red bell pepper
- tomato
- lime
- cilantro
- garlic
- black pepper
- salt

# Guac

Every millenial has “the best guac recipe”, here’s mine

- avocados
- red onion
- lime
- cilantro
- mexican crema
- black pepper
- salt

A tip borrowed from hummus… a layer of avocado oil on top of the guac will prevent it from browning and has minimal impact on the flavor of the guac.

# Hot dogs are not a sandwich

BBQ chips suck

I subscribe to [the cube rule](https://cuberule.com) of food. The cube rule of food states that every food can be categorized by the location of the structural starch. By that logic, a hot dog is not a sandwich, but a taco.

Grilling/cookouts/bbq are a classic way to bring people together. Summer, alcohol, yard games, pool/lake. BBQ has roots in Brazil but has been co-opted as an American cuisine.

My memories up north

Exercise in scalable cooking. Can flex/scale the menu for any group size. I love this menu because the salad dressings all come from one base sauce and the bbq sauces all come from one base sauce.

All about the sides. Doesn’t have to be a pig, pig is impressive but kind of underwhelming flavor wise. Ribs and brisket much better but also more expensive

[Home Production of Quality Meats and Sausages](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982426739?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_M0RH0R07H40YCEC2GGEF)

Regardless of what type of meat you choose to prepare, I would recommend the book Home Production of Quality Meats and Sausages by Stanley Marianski. It’s extremely thorough. While you don’t need to read it cover to cover, understanding the basics of food safety, curing, smoking, etc will take you far as you cook large scale meals and venture into areas like fermenting/pickling, etc.

# Every culture has a dumpling

Authenticity in food is a construct of a person’s sentimental value at a point in time. Without perspective, authenticity can’t exist because the food of any given culture is a gradient of the food of all the cultures in touches.

- Pad Thai
- Tempura was introduced to Japan by the Portuguese

[TIL that over 65% of the world's population is lactose intolerant](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/m2f57q/til_that_over_65_of_the_worlds_population_is/)

A couple weeks ago I stumbled upon a Reddit post like the one above. I was surprised that a majority of people could have lactose intolerance, and have it be considered the exception rather than the norm in society.

I ran a quick survey to see if most people had the same misconception as me, and at least among my LinkedIn followers they do.

Around 3/4 of responders thought that less than 1/2 of people have a lactose intolerance. Meanwhile only 1/3 of people actually produce lactase.

Digging in deeper, I found that the countries with the lowest percentage of lactose intolerance are concentrated in Europe.

Most people probably think they're in the minority because dietary guidelines are catered to white people.

Lactose intolerance is sort of a good analogy for discrimination in America. Most non-white people experience it, but we largely talk about their experiences in a vacuum from one another which distracts from the fact that the cause is white supremacy
