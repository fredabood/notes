# Build Your Own Benny Bar

Benedicts should be a la carte

Fun brunch party I’ve done several times

Hard boiled egg yolks are one of the worst textures in all of food. No one has ever said “I wish this was a little more chalky”. Sometimes people respond to this and say something along the lines of “what about a 6 minute egg”. That’s a soft boiled egg.

Donuts are not meal. They're a breakfast dessert. Desserts are a snack or a course within a meal, not a whole meal.
