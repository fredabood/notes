# Every Chimichuri - Spring rolls

Limes are the worst citrus. They are strictly relegated food and beverage from regions previously colonized by the Spanish.

Colonialism - Jalapeños, Limes, and Cilantro

# Mediterranean Chimmichurri - Green Onion Cucumber Salad

Oh wow thank you. I didn’t really write it down. It’s a tweak of a southeast Asian chimichuri that I’ve been making. The dressing was equal parts fish sauce, lemon juice, and rice vinegar. Honey and salt to taste and a little yogurt for fat.

Then I think for the veg it was probably like fennel, cucumber, dill, parsley, mint, yellow onion, green onion. But I don’t remember for sure. Probably do like 2 or three cucumbers per bulb of fennel. And I included all the like stringy leaves from the fennel and the white bulb, but not the green stalks.

# Nouc Cham Pickled Chimichurri

First make the fish sauce mixture with approximately equal parts

- Lime juice
- Fish sauce
- Rice vinegar

Mix approximately 1 tbsp honey and 1 tsp salt per cup of total fish sauce mixture.

Use a small amount of the fish sauce mix to thin the honey and and salt. Add the thinned honey and salt to the remaining fish sauce mix.

Chop approximately equal parts

- Cilantro
- Mint
- Basil
- Scallion

Chop and add red jalapeno chilis for color and spice

You can change it up pretty easily too. The first time I made it I used Thai basil, but this recipe uses a mint/basil combo instead so it’s more accessible. You can also swap the red jalapeno for birdseye or Thai chilis.
