# A Book About Food

## Unrequested opinions from a non-expert.

This is entire series is a mixed bag of summaries of topics I’ve found interesting enough to research over the years as well as a lot of strong opinions loosely held.

I’m a 3rd generation American I come from a big Lebanese americans with a lot of crazy American Dream stories of relatives who “made it” in America. At this point we’re almost entirely assimilated, our primary connection to the culture is through the food. At this point I have a cousin in almost every major US city, and everyone in my family can cook. As you can imagine, food has a central place in my life and cooking is my passion. While my Lebanese heritage probably instilled my love for food, my pallet and my cooking venture far outside that domain.

Feeding people is my love language and my favorite way to bring people together. Consider myself a homemaker and i love to host. Throughout this book i delve into the menus from different parties I’ve hosted. I discuss the cookout as an exercise in the scalability of a menu, my mac n cheese article was originally written for a cooking class i led for some coworkers, my eggs benny party is the pinacle of my sauce making as it involves a hugely variable menu with several components. Every party needs a good signature cocktail to accompany the food, so I’ve written a chapter on designing balanced cocktails that discusses the components of a balanced dish. In many ways mixology is the ultimate exercise in balance. It’s the ultimate exercise in designing a flavor profile that has both depth and a balance without being overly complicated. Similar to the brunch party, the cookout can be an exercise in sauce making depending on the sides you choose. Most of the side recipes I’ve included here have a sauce or dressing component. This section maximizes scalability by using 2 base sauces, then branching out the final results from those base sauces.
