# Caramelized onions

Bulk caramelize your onions in a slow cooker

Fill the slow cooker with as many yellow onions as you can fit.

Give them a liberal toss with salt, pepper, and olive oil.

Let them cook on low over night or until they’re fully caramelized.

Freeze them in an ice cube tray that makes large cubes.
