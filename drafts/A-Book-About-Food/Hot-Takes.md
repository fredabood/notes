# Hot Takes

- Limes are the worst citrus. They should be strictly relegated food and beverage from regions previously colonized by the Spanish.
- Sweet potatoes are the worst potatoes
- Ketchup sucks
- Hot dogs are not a sandwich, they’re a taco
- BBQ chips suck
- Squash shouldn’t go in drinks
- Honeydew is the worst fruit
- No one has ever deliberately chosen a pear over an apple
- Cream (cheese) doesn’t go in sushi, salad dressing, or carbonara.
- Hard boiled egg yolks are one of the worst textures in all of food.
- Potato, chicken, pasta, egg, tuna salads are in fact salads. Salads are a vehicle for dressing, not defined by healthy.
- Donuts are not meal. They're a breakfast dessert. Desserts are a snack or a course within a meal, not a whole meal.
- Sourdough bread… don’t waste your time
- Smoothies are just cold soups and many soups are hot smoothies.
- Veg/vegan food shouldn’t try to be like meat
