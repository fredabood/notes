# The Cookout - Hot dogs are not a sandwich

BBQ chips suck

I subscribe to [the cube rule](https://cuberule.com) of food. The cube rule of food states that every food can be categorized by the location of the structural starch. By that logic, a hot dog is not a sandwich, but a taco.

Grilling/cookouts/bbq are a classic way to bring people together. Summer, alcohol, yard games, pool/lake. BBQ has roots in Brazil but has been co-opted as an American cuisine.

My memories up north

Exercise in scalable cooking. Can flex/scale the menu for any group size. I love this menu because the salad dressings all come from one base sauce and the bbq sauces all come from one base sauce.

All about the sides. Doesn’t have to be a pig, pig is impressive but kind of underwhelming flavor wise. Ribs and brisket much better but also more expensive

Regardless of what type of meat you choose to prepare, I would recommend the book Home Production of Quality Meats and Sausages by Stanley Marianski. It’s extremely thorough. While you don’t need to read it cover to cover, understanding the basics of food safety, curing, smoking, etc will take you far as you cook large scale meals and venture into areas like fermenting/pickling, etc.
