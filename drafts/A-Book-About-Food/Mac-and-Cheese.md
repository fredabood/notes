# Mac and Cheese: A lesson in sauce-making

Anyone who wants to cook along should make a bechamel-based mac and cheese (see article 3). This is uses only common household ingredients and has the widest application in cooking outside of mac and cheese. Making a roux is a basic life skill, and is the base for 3/5 of [the French mother sauces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mother_sauces).

Additionally, I will also make the “modern” cheese sauce (see article 3) so we can compare it to the bechamel. I will also make a pasta water-based sauce using the technique from article 4. This should give everyone a base understanding of various sauce-making techniques.

#### Takeaways

By the end of the lesson everyone should have a basic understanding of:

- Emulsification and its applications in the kitchen
- How to make a roux and how to use it to make sauces, gravies, etc.
- Multiple methods to make mac and cheese

#### Pre-Work

### [Mise en Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place)

The most complicated part of mac and cheese is the cheese sauce, so that will be the primary focus of this lesson. If you plan on cooking along with me, all prep work should be done ahead of time. This includes chopping veggies/herbs, shredding cheese, grinding fresh spices, and cooking any meat/veggies.

#### Reading/Watching

1. [Emulsification](https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/cooking-tips/article/become-a-better-cook-4): All the cheese sauces we’re making are emulsifications. Understanding what that means will help you make a better sauce.
2. [Mornay Sauce](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/08/mornay-sauce-recipe.html): The bechamel-based sauce we’ll be making is actually a Mornay sauce.
3. [Two Roads to [...] Mac and Cheese](https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/11/how-to-make-baked-mac-and-cheese.html): This presents two methods to making great mac and cheese, we’ll explore both of them.
4. [Lighter Fettuccine Alfredo](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/09/lighter-fettuccine-alfredo-recipe.html):  This presents a third method to making a cheese sauce that we will touch on. I would also recommend the cacio e pepe episode of Good Eats Reloaded on Hulu, but the technique is essentially the same as this article.
5. [The Food Lab: 15-Minute Ultra-Gooey Stovetop Mac and Cheese](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/10/the-food-lab-fifteen-minute-stovetop-macaroni-and-cheese-recipe-food-lab-book-excerpt.html): A fourth method to making a cheese sauce, which we will not explore. However, after the lesson you should be confident enough to do this yourself.

#### Shopping List

See [the bechamel-based mac and cheese](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/11/classic-bechamel-baked-mac-cheese-recipe.html) from article 3 if you want an exact recipe.

#### Required

- Cheese
    - Approximately 2 lbs, but it’s better to have extra on hand in case you accidentally end up with too much bechamel
    - I usually use cheddar/gruyere/american with an approximate 3:2:1 ratio, respectively
    - You can sub out the cheddar and gruyere for any cheese that melts (see the table at the end of article 3)
- Pasta – Anything will do
- Milk – About a pint, but it’s good to have extra in case you need to thin out your sauce
- Butter – About half a stick, again it’s good to have extra in case you add too much flour to the roux
- Flour – About equal parts with the butter, but if the sauce gets too thin you’ll need more to thicken it up
- Mustard – I use Dijon, but yellow or spicy brown would work
- Hot sauce – Anything generic is fine, but feel free to get adventurous here.
- Nutmeg – Fresh grated is better, but ground is fine too.
- Pepper – Never buy pre-ground black pepper
- Salt – to taste

#### Optional

- [Breadcrumbs](https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-make-breadcrumbs/) (for a toasted crust)
- Garlic, Freshly minced and sautéed
- Onion, diced and sautéed
- Onions, caramelized (you can do these in a slow cooker, then freeze them for dishes like mac and cheese)
- really any [alliums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium) will work, I frequently add them to the butter when making my roux to fortify the base of the dish
- blue cheese crumbles, stir in at the end for little blue cheese bombs
- Broccoli, chopped and cooked (for the illusion of health)
- Bacon, [lardons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lardon) (to tone down the illusion of health from the broccoli)
- Mushrooms, chopped and sautéed
- Parsley/chives/green onion, chopped (to garnish)
- Anything else you want… you can really take this any direction you can imagine… kimchi/pork belly, caprese salad, phily cheese steak… it’s all fair game.
