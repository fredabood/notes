#### Sausage Gravy Benny

Sausage Gravy

- Get some onions (minced/finely chopped) an garlic going in the pan with some butter
- Start cooking sausage in the same pan until the fat is rendered out
- Add flour to form a roux and start stirring in milk to make a gravy, I usually use whole milk
- Add butter/flour/milk until you get a good texture
- Fresh cracked black pepper to taste

Toast and English muffin, add sausage patty, add egg, smother with gravy
