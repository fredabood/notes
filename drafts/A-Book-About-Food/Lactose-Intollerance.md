[TIL that over 65% of the world's population is lactose intolerant](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/m2f57q/til_that_over_65_of_the_worlds_population_is/)

A couple weeks ago I stumbled upon a Reddit post like the one above. I was surprised that a majority of people could have lactose intolerance, and have it be considered the exception rather than the norm in society.

I ran a quick survey to see if most people had the same misconception as me, and at least among my LinkedIn followers they do.

Around 3/4 of responders thought that less than 1/2 of people have a lactose intolerance. Meanwhile only 1/3 of people actually produce lactase.

Digging in deeper, I found that the countries with the lowest percentage of lactose intolerance are concentrated in Europe.

Most people probably think they're in the minority because dietary guidelines are catered to white people.

Lactose intolerance is sort of a good analogy for discrimination in America. Most non-white people experience it, but we largely talk about their experiences in a vacuum from one another which distracts from the fact that the cause is white supremacy
