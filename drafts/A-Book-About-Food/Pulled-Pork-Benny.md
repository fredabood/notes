#### Pulled pork benny

- Make your favorite pulled pork, I usually do this in a slow cooker with some onions/garlic and Dr Pepper/root beer the night before
- Make a cheese sauce following the same instructions as the French onion soup but don’t use gruyere. Probably a cheddar or some sort of blend of cheddar/gruyere. Could make this spicy
- You could also reduce the juice left in the slow cooker with a dash of bbq or mustard, then toss the pulled pork (one serving at a time) in that sauce before putting it on the benny
- Toast the English muffin, add pulled pork, add egg, smoother in cheese sauce
