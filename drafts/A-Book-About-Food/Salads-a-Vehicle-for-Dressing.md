Salads are not defined by how healthy they are or whether they contain leafy greens. A salad is really a vehicle for a dressing. By this definition, potato, chicken, pasta, egg, tuna salads are in fact salads.

Cream (cheese) doesn’t go in sushi, salad dressing, or carbonara; and ranch is a condiment, not a dressing.
